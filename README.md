# Banking-App-Mock-Compose

**Banking-App-Mock-Compose** is an android app written with **Jetpack Compose**

The primary purpose of the app is to practice layout of medium-size app in Compose instead of Android Views. 

The details of all other layers except ui may be missing or be simplified. 
For example, for banking profile the app uses local mock Repositories with static data with no remote datasource.
